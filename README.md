# Economic Systems Simulation Toolkit (MATLAB)

A MATLAB-based toolkit for modelling economic interactions, market behaviour,
and financial trading systems. Designed to support economic policy analysis,
inequality modelling, and market forecasting for UK institutions such as
HMRC, HMT, and ONS.

## Key Models
### 1️⃣ Moving Average Trading Algorithm
- Cross-over trading rules (3-day vs 7-day MA)
- Profitability analysis on FTSE 100 sample data
- Policy relevance: Financial stability & risk simulations

### 2️⃣ Buyer–Seller Equilibrium Simulation
- Interaction matching based on price thresholds
- Nash equilibrium search across agent behaviours
- Policy relevance: Wage inequality & market functioning



## Policy Applications
- Wealth distribution modelling (HMRC)
- Labour market dynamics (ONS)
- Macroprudential simulation (BoE)
